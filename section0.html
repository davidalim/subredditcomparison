        	<h2>Welcome!</h2>
        	<p>
        		Welcome to <b>David</b> and <b>Simon</b>'s final project for the
        		<a href="http://www.kurser.dtu.dk/02805.aspx?menulanguage=en-gb" target="blank">
        			Social Graphs and Interaction
        		</a>
        		class at Technical University of Denmark (DTU). 
        	<p>
        		Over this course, we have learned how to use several tools to learn about and 
        		analyze different networks and communities. We became interested in using these tools to 
        		explore communities found on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/" target="blank">Reddit</a>.
        		If you aren't familiar with Reddit, there is a 
        		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlI022aUWQQ" target="blank">neat video</a> that explains
        		it.
        	<p>
        		In our project, we look at two specific subreddit communities: 
        		<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/" target="blank">Christianity</a> and
        		<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Islam/" target="blank">Islam</a>. While seemingly totally different
        		communities, we believe that the users are actually quite similar. Throughout this website, we'll explore 
        		just <b>how similar they are</b> by using some interesting concepts and tools.
