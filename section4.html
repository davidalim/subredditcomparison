        	<h2>What Do We Know?</h2>
        	<p>
        		After looking at the subreddits <b>as a whole</b> as well as the 
        		<b>users that make them up</b>, it seems that the Reddit communities formed by 
        		the Christianity and Islam subreddits aren't too different. We've seen that when put
        		together, the users don't seem to have more of a connection to users of the same subreddit,
        		and that groups are formed based on other criterea. We've also seen that the Christianity 
        		and Islam communities share the most central or important subreddits. Furthermore, we've seen 
        		that the things they write about whithin their subreddit have some substantial commonground in the 
        		topics that they discuss. 
    		<p>
    			If you are interested in doing something similar with other subreddit communities, feel free
    			to use our code on Github for inspiration!
